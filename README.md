# Capacitive-Power-Transfer-Low-Power-
Capacitive Power Transfer is a upcoming technology that is a direct competitor to inductive power transfer. This project will document my personal project and the methodologies used to design the system. 
The CPT system will be a low-voltage and low-power inorder to keep the required frequency low and prevent excessive voltage's over components.
